    "```fortran\n",
    "DO 10 I = 1,100\n",

    "> If you have a difficult time seeing the difference, don’t feel too bad. It took the NASA programmer a couple weeks to notice that there is a period between `1` and `100` instead of a comma. Because the Fortran compiler ignored whitespace, `DO 10 I` was taken to be a variable name, and the statement `DO 10 I = 1.100` resulted in assigning `1.100` to a variable called `DO10I` instead of introducing a loop.\n",
