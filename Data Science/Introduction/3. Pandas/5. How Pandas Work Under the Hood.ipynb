    "Note that `category` is also not translatable into C. `category` is similar to a `tuple` in that it is intended to hold a collection of categorical variables, meaning metadata with a fixed unique set of values. Because it’s not translatable into C, it should never be used to hold data that needs to be analyzed. Its advantage mainly comes in its ability to sort things in a custom sort order efficiently and simply. Underneath it looks like a data array of indexes where the indexes correspond to a unique value in an array of categories. The documentation claims that it can result in a huge memory savings when using string categories. Of course, we know  that Python already has a built-in string cache that does that for us automatically for certain strings so this would really only make a difference if the strings contained characters other than alphanumeric and underscore."
