It branched off from the much wider SciPy module in early 2005 and had its first stable release in mid-2006. Since then, it has enjoyed growing popularity among Pythonists who work in the mathematics, science, and engineering fields. The goal of this book is to make you conversant enough with NumPy so that you're able to use it and can build complex scientific applications with it."

Surely, one can perform complex mathematical operations on any abstract data type, such as a list. The answer lies in the numerous properties of arrays that make them significantly more useful.

    "The abstract mathematical concepts of matrices and vectors are central to many scientific problems. Arrays provide a direct semantic link to these concepts. Indeed, whenever a piece of mathematical literature makes reference to a matrix, one can safely think of an array as the software abstraction that represents the matrix. In scientific literature, an expression such as $A_{ij}$ is typically used to denote the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of array `A`. The corresponding expression in NumPy would simply be `A[i,j]`. For matrix operations, NumPy arrays also support **vectorization** (details are addressed later, Using NumPy Arrays), which speeds up execution greatly. Vectorization makes the code more concise, easier to read, and much more akin to mathematical notation. Like matrices, arrays can be multidimensional too. Every element of an array is addressable through a set of integers called indices, and the process of accessing elements of an array with sets of integers is called **indexing**. This functionality can indeed be implemented without using arrays, but this would be cumbersome and quite unnecessary."

    "Efficiency can mean a number of things in software. The term may be used to refer to the speed of execution of a program, its data retrieval and storage performance, its memory overhead (the memory consumed when a program is executing), or its overall throughput. NumPy arrays are better than most other data structures with respect to almost all of these characteristics (with a few exceptions such as pandas, DataFrames, or SciPy's sparse matrices, which we shall deal with later). Since NumPy arrays are statically typed and homogenous, fast mathematical operations can be implemented in compiled languages (the default implementation uses C and Fortran). Efficiency (the availability of fast algorithms working on homogeneous arrays) makes NumPy popular and important."

    "Notice the subtle difference between the arguments passed to the two functions. **The `random` function accepts a tuple** as an argument and creates an array with dimensionality equal to the length of the tuple. The respective dimensions have their lengths equal to the elements of the tuple. **The `rand` function, on the other hand, takes any number of integer arguments** and returns a random array such that its dimensionality is equal to the number of integer arguments passed to the function, and the respective dimensions have lengths equal to the values of the integer arguments. Thus, `x` in the preceding snippet is a three-dimensional array (the number of the arguments passed to the function), and each of the three dimensions of `x` has a length of 2 (the value of each of the arguments). `rand` is a convenience function for `random`. Both these functions can be used interchangeably, provided the arguments that are passed are respectively valid for either function."

So, just apply these arithmetic operations:"

With the help of NumPy operations, the performance is way faster than an ordinary Python `for` loop (we use a list comprehension here for neat code, which is faster than an ordinary Python `for` loop, but still, NumPy has better performance when compared to the ordinary Python `for` loop).
