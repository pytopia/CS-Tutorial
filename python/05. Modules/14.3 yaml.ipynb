    "**Y**AML **A**in't **M**arkup **L**anguage (**YAML**) is a serialization language that has steadily increased in popularity over the last few years. It's often used as a format for configuration files, but its object serialization abilities make it a viable replacement for languages like JSON. This YAML tutorial will demonstrate the language syntax with a guide and some simple coding examples in Python. YAML has broad language support and maps easily into native data structures. It's also easy to for humans to read, which is why it's a good choice for configuration. The YAML acronym was shorthand for **Yet Another Markup Language**. But the maintainers renamed it to **YAML Ain't Markup Language** to place more emphasis on its data-oriented features."
