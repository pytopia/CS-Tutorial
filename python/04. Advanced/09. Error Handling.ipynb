    "- `raise` allows you to throw an exception at any time.\n",
    "- `assert` enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isn’t.\n",
    "- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.\n",
    "- `except` is used to catch and handle the `exception(s)` that are encountered in the `try` clause.\n",
    "- `else` lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.\n",
    "- `finally` enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.\n",
