    "Descriptors are a specific Python feature that power a lot of the magic hidden under the language’s hood. If you’ve ever thought that Python descriptors are an advanced topic with few practical applications, then this tutorial is the perfect tool to help you understand this powerful feature. You’ll come to understand why Python descriptors are such an interesting topic, and what kind of use cases you can apply them to."

    "## What Are Python Descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors are Python objects that implement a method of the descriptor protocol, which gives you the ability to create objects that have special behavior when they’re accessed as attributes of other objects. They are a general-purpose way of intercepting attribute access. Descriptors are the mechanism behind properties' static methods, class methods, super methods, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can see the correct definition of the descriptor protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "__get__(self, obj, type=None) -> object\n",
    "__set__(self, obj, value) -> None\n",
    "__delete__(self, obj) -> None\n",
    "__set_name__(self, owner, name)\n",
    "```"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "If your descriptor implements just `.__get__()`, then it’s said to be a **non-data descriptor**. If it implements `.__set__()` or `.__delete__()`, then it’s said to be a **data descriptor**. Note that this difference is not just about the name, but it’s also a difference in behavior. The non-data descriptors are only readable while the data descriptors are both readable and writable. That’s because data descriptors have precedence during the lookup process, as you’ll see later on."

    "A descriptor is what we call any object that defines `__get__()`, `__set__()`, or `__delete__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optionally, descriptors can have a `__set_name__()` method. This is only used in cases where a descriptor needs to know either the class where it was created or the name of class variable it was assigned to. (This method, if present, is called even if the class is not a descriptor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptors get invoked by the dot “operator” during attribute lookup. If a descriptor is accessed indirectly with `vars(some_class)[descriptor_name]`, the descriptor instance is returned without invoking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptors only work when used as class variables. When put in instances, they have no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main motivation for descriptors is to provide a hook allowing objects stored in class variables to control what happens during attribute lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditionally, the calling class controls what happens during lookup. Descriptors invert that relationship and allow the data being looked-up to have a say in the matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptors are used throughout the language. It is how functions turn into bound methods. Common tools like `classmethod()`, `staticmethod()`, `property()`, and `functools.cached_property()` are all implemented as descriptors."
