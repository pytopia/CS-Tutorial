    "Python is a high-level, interpreted scripting language developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The initial version was published at the alt.sources newsgroup in 1991, and version 1.0 was released in 1994."

At that time, the development team made the decision to release version 3.0, which contained a few relatively small but significant changes that were not backward compatible with the 2.x versions. Python 2 and 3 are very similar, and some features of Python 3 have been backported to Python 2. But in general, they remain not quite compatible."

It is common to find references to Monty Python sketches and movies scattered throughout the Python documentation."

    "### Python is Popular\n",
    "Python has been growing in popularity over the last few years. The [2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018) ranked Python as the 7th most popular and the number one most wanted technology of the year. [World-class software development companies around the globe use Python every single day](https://realpython.com/world-class-companies-using-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [research by Dice](https://insights.dice.com/2016/02/01/whats-hot-and-not-in-tech-skills/) Python is also one of the hottest skills to have and the most popular programming language in the world based on the [Popularity of Programming Language Index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the popularity and widespread use of Python as a programming language, Python developers are sought after and paid well. If you’d like to dig deeper into [Python salary statistics and job opportunities, you can do so here](https://dbader.org/blog/why-learn-python)."

    "### Python is Interpreted\n",
    "Many languages are compiled, meaning the source code you create needs to be translated into machine code, the language of your computer’s processor, before it can be run. Programs written in an interpreted language are passed straight to an interpreter that runs them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes for a quicker development cycle because you just type in your code and run it, without the intermediate compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential downside to interpreted languages is execution speed. Programs that are compiled into the native language of the computer processor tend to run more quickly than interpreted programs. For some applications that are particularly computationally intensive, like graphics processing or intense number crunching, this can be limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, however, for most programs, the difference in execution speed is measured in milliseconds, or seconds at most, and not appreciably noticeable to a human user. The expediency of coding in an interpreted language is typically worth it for most applications."

    "\n",
    "A version of the interpreter is available for virtually any platform there is, including all flavors of Unix, Windows, macOS, smartphones and tablets, and probably anything else you ever heard of. A version even exists for the half dozen people remaining who use OS/2."

    "As programming languages go, Python is relatively uncluttered, and the developers have deliberately kept it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rough estimate of the complexity of a language can be gleaned from the number of keywords or reserved words in the language. These are words that are reserved for special meaning by the compiler or interpreter because they designate specific built-in functionality of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 has 33 keywords, and Python 2 has 31. By contrast, C++ has 62, Java has 53, and Visual Basic has more than 120, though these latter examples probably vary somewhat by implementation or dialect.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, a very extensive library of classes and functions is available that provides capability well beyond what is built into the language, such as database manipulation or GUI programming.\n",
