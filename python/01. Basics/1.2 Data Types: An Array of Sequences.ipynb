    "Before creating Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC language—a 10-year research project to design a programming environment for beginners. ABC introduced many ideas we now consider “Pythonic”: generic operations on different types of sequences, built-in tuple and mapping types, structure by indentation, strong typing without variable declarations, and more. It’s no accident that Python is so user-friendly."

That’s why an ‍`array` with floats is much more compact than a `tuple` of floats: the `array` is a single object holding the raw values of the floats, while the tuple is several objects—the tuple itself and each float object contained in it."

    "A Python array is as lean as a C array. As shown in the previous figure, an array of float values does not hold full-fledged float instances, but only the packed bytes representing their machine values—similar to an array of double in the C language. When creating an array, you provide a `typecode`, a letter to determine the underlying C type used to store each item in the array. For example, `b` is the `typecode` for **signed char**. If you create an `array('b')`, then each item will be stored in a single byte and interpreted as an integer from –128 to 127. For large sequences of numbers, this saves a lot of memory. And Python will not let you put any number that does not match the type for the array."

That is nearly 60 times faster than reading the numbers from a text file, which also involves parsing each line with the float built-in. Saving with `array.tofile` is about 7 times faster than writing one float per line in a text file. In addition, the size of the binary file with 10 million doubles is 80,000,000 bytes (8 bytes per double, zero overhead), while the text file has 181,515,739 bytes, for the same data."
